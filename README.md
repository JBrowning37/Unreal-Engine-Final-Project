# Unreal-Engine-Final-Project

This is the final assignment in the C++ and Unreal Engine Course from The Tech Academy. The task was to create a basic game that had a main menu and a single level. 
The level had to have a win condition and goal. 

I chose to create a simple game in which you need to find the key and unlock the door to win. I utilized quixel bridge assets to create a basic scene and add some interesting landscaping.
